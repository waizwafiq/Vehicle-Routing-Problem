## Project Description
**Description** <br>
Trying to solve the infamous "Vehicle Routing Problem" (VRP)<br>
Actually, it is more about simulation on traversal search algorithms in graphs.

**Problem Statement**<br>
A simulation is needed for delivery vehicles to travel all around the map and find the shortest path to deliver the packages while the capacity in the vehicle is sufficient.

**Timeline** <br>
May 2021 - Present

This is the **CLI** part.
